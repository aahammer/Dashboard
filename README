# A technology test combining AngularJS and D3.js into a modular dashboard front end

After doing some minor data driven documents with D3.js, i searched for a more consistent way to combine different D3.js views into a single dashboard application.
Since i also wanted to get some experience with solid web app framework, i decided to use AngularJS for a more modulized data driven document. 

### The AngularJS / D3.js Dashboard Protoapp

The AngularJS / D3.js Dashboard Protoapp on Heroku. The app displays some randomly generated patient survey data in a medical setting.
All components are wired in order to offer a reactive navigation experience to the user.
